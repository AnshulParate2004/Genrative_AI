{"title": "World", "content": "The world is the totality of entities, the whole of reality, or everything that exists.[1] The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields. Some conceptions see the world as unique, while others talk of a \"plurality of worlds\". Some treat the world as one simple object, while others analyze the world as a complex made up of parts.\nIn scientific cosmology, the world or universe is commonly defined as \"the totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be\". Theories of modality talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things could have been. Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon, or the \"horizon of all horizons\". In philosophy of mind, the world is contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind.\nTheology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation, as identical to God, or as the two being interdependent. In religions, there is a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice. A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is found in religions, is known as a worldview. Cosmogony is the field that studies the origin or creation of the world, while eschatology refers to the science or doctrine of the last things or of the end of the world.\nIn various contexts, the term \"world\" takes a more restricted meaning associated, for example, with the Earth and all life on it, with humanity as a whole, or with an international or intercontinental scope. In this sense, world history refers to the history of humanity as a whole, and world politics is the discipline of political science studying issues that transcend nations and continents. Other examples include terms such as \"world religion\", \"world language\", \"world government\", \"world war\", \"world population\", \"world economy\", or \"world championship\".\nThe English word world comes from the Old English weorold. The Old English is a reflex of the Common Germanic *weraldiz, a compound of weraz 'man' and aldiz 'age', thus literally meaning roughly 'age of man';[2] this word led to Old Frisian warld, Old Saxon werold, Old Dutch werolt, Old High German weralt, and Old Norse verÇ«ld.[3]\nThe corresponding word in Latin is mundus, literally 'clean, elegant', itself a loan translation of Greek cosmos 'orderly arrangement'. While the Germanic word thus reflects a mythological notion of a \"domain of Man\" (compare Midgard), presumably as opposed to the divine sphere on the one hand and the chthonic sphere of the underworld on the other, the Greco-Latin term expresses a notion of creation as an act of establishing order out of chaos.[4]\nDifferent fields often work with quite different conceptions of the essential features associated with the term \"world\".[5][6] Some conceptions see the world as unique: there can be no more than one world. Others talk of a \"plurality of worlds\".[4] Some see worlds as complex things composed of many substances as their parts while others hold that worlds are simple in the sense that there is only one substance: the world as a whole.[7] Some characterize worlds in terms of objective spacetime while others define them relative to the horizon present in each experience. These different characterizations are not always exclusive: it may be possible to combine some without leading to a contradiction. Most of them agree that worlds are unified totalities.[5][6]\nMonism is a thesis about oneness: that only one thing exists in a certain sense. The denial of monism is pluralism, the thesis that, in a certain sense, more than one thing exists.[7] There are many forms of monism and pluralism, but in relation to the world as a whole, two are of special interest: existence monism/pluralism and priority monism/pluralism. Existence monism states that the world is the only concrete object there is.[7][8][9] This means that all the concrete \"objects\" we encounter in our daily lives, including apples, cars and ourselves, are not truly objects in a strict sense. Instead, they are just dependent aspects of the world-object.[7] Such a world-object is simple in the sense that it does not have any genuine parts. For this reason, it has also been referred to as \"blobject\" since it lacks an internal structure like a blob.[10] Priority monism allows that there are other concrete objects besides the world.[7] But it holds that these objects do not have the most fundamental form of existence, that they somehow depend on the existence of the world.[9][11] The corresponding forms of pluralism state that the world is complex in the sense that it is made up of concrete, independent objects.[7]\nScientific cosmology can be defined as the science of the universe as a whole. In it, the terms \"universe\" and \"cosmos\" are usually used as synonyms for the term \"world\".[12] One common definition of the world/universe found in this field is as \"[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be\".[13][5][6] Some definitions emphasize that there are two other aspects to the universe besides spacetime: forms of energy or matter, like stars and particles, and laws of nature.[14] World-conceptions in this field differ both concerning their notion of spacetime and of the contents of spacetime. The theory of relativity plays a central role in modern cosmology and its conception of space and time. A difference from its predecessors is that it conceives space and time not as distinct dimensions but as a single four-dimensional manifold called spacetime.[15] This can be seen in special relativity in relation to the Minkowski metric, which includes both spatial and temporal components in its definition of distance.[16] General relativity goes one step further by integrating the concept of mass into the concept of spacetime as its curvature.[16] Quantum cosmology uses a classical notion of spacetime and conceives the whole world as one big wave function expressing the probability of finding particles in a given location.[17]\nThe world-concept plays a role in many modern theories of modality, sometimes in the form of possible worlds.[18] A possible world is a complete and consistent way how things could have been.[19] The actual world is a possible world since the way things are is a way things could have been. There are many other ways things could have been besides how they actually are. For example, Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 US election, but she could have won them. So there is a possible world in which she did. There is a vast number of possible worlds, one corresponding to each such difference, no matter how small or big, as long as no outright contradictions are introduced this way.[19]\nPossible worlds are often conceived as abstract objects, for example, in terms of non-obtaining states of affairs or as maximally consistent sets of propositions.[20][21] On such a view, they can even be seen as belonging to the actual world.[22] Another way to conceive possible worlds, made famous by David Lewis, is as concrete entities.[4] On this conception, there is no important difference between the actual world and possible worlds: both are conceived as concrete, inclusive and spatiotemporally connected.[19] The only difference is that the actual world is the world we live in, while other possible worlds are not inhabited by us but by our counterparts.[23] Everything within a world is spatiotemporally connected to everything else but the different worlds do not share a common spacetime: They are spatiotemporally isolated from each other.[19] This is what makes them separate worlds.[23]\nIt has been suggested that, besides possible worlds, there are also impossible worlds. Possible worlds are ways things could have been, so impossible worlds are ways things could not have been.[24][25] Such worlds involve a contradiction, like a world in which Hillary Clinton both won and lost the 2016 US election. Both possible and impossible worlds have in common the idea that they are totalities of their constituents.[24][26]\nWithin phenomenology, worlds are defined in terms of horizons of experiences.[5][6] When we perceive an object, like a house, we do not just experience this object at the center of our attention but also various other objects surrounding it, given in the periphery.[27] The term \"horizon\" refers to these co-given objects, which are usually experienced only in a vague, indeterminate manner.[28][29] The perception of a house involves various horizons, corresponding to the neighborhood, the city, the country, the Earth, etc. In this context, the world is the biggest horizon or the \"horizon of all horizons\".[27][5][6] It is common among phenomenologists to understand the world not just as a spatiotemporal collection of objects but as additionally incorporating various other relations between these objects. These relations include, for example, indication-relations that help us anticipate one object given the appearances of another object and means-end-relations or functional involvements relevant for practical concerns.[27]\nIn philosophy of mind, the term \"world\" is commonly used in contrast to the term \"mind\" as that which is represented by the mind. This is sometimes expressed by stating that there is a gap between mind and world and that this gap needs to be overcome for representation to be successful.[30][31][32] One problem in philosophy of mind is to explain how the mind is able to bridge this gap and to enter into genuine mind-world-relations, for example, in the form of perception, knowledge or action.[33][34] This is necessary for the world to be able to rationally constrain the activity of the mind.[30][35] According to a realist position, the world is something distinct and independent from the mind.[36] Idealists conceive of the world as partially or fully determined by the mind.[36][37] Immanuel Kant's transcendental idealism, for example, posits that the spatiotemporal structure of the world is imposed by the mind on reality but lacks independent existence otherwise.[38] A more radical idealist conception of the world can be found in Berkeley's subjective idealism, which holds that the world as a whole, including all everyday objects like tables, cats, trees and ourselves, \"consists of nothing but minds and ideas\".[39]\nDifferent theological positions hold different conceptions of the world based on its relation to God. Classical theism states that God is wholly distinct from the world. But the world depends for its existence on God, both because God created the world and because He maintains or conserves it.[40][41][42] This is sometimes understood in analogy to how humans create and conserve ideas in their imagination, with the difference being that the divine mind is vastly more powerful.[40] On such a view, God has absolute, ultimate reality in contrast to the lower ontological status ascribed to the world.[42] God's involvement in the world is often understood along the lines of a personal, benevolent God who looks after and guides His creation.[41] Deists agree with theists that God created the world but deny any subsequent, personal involvement in it.[43] Pantheists reject the separation between God and world. Instead, they claim that the two are identical. This means that there is nothing to the world that does not belong to God and that there is nothing to God beyond what is found in the world.[42][44] Panentheism constitutes a middle ground between theism and pantheism. Against theism, it holds that God and the world are interrelated and depend on each other. Against pantheism, it holds that there is no outright identity between the two.[42][45]\nIn philosophy, the term world has several possible meanings. In some contexts, it refers to everything that makes up reality or the physical universe. In others, it can mean have a specific ontological sense (see world disclosure). While clarifying the concept of world has arguably always been among the basic tasks of Western philosophy, this theme appears to have been raised explicitly only at the start of the twentieth century,[46]\nPlato is well known for his theory of forms, which posits the existence of two different worlds: the sensible world and the intelligible world. The sensible world is the world we live in, filled with changing physical things we can see, touch and interact with. The intelligible world is the world of invisible, eternal, changeless forms like goodness, beauty, unity and sameness.[47][48][49] Plato ascribes a lower ontological status to the sensible world, which only imitates the world of forms. This is due to the fact that physical things exist only to the extent that they participate in the forms that characterize them, while the forms themselves have an independent manner of existence.[47][48][49] In this sense, the sensible world is a mere replication of the perfect exemplars found in the world of forms: it never lives up to the original. In the allegory of the cave, Plato compares the physical things we are familiar with to mere shadows of the real things. But not knowing the difference, the prisoners in the cave mistake the shadows for the real things.[50]\nTwo definitions that were both put forward in the 1920s, however, suggest the range of available opinion. \"The world is everything that is the case\", wrote Ludwig Wittgenstein in his influential Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, first published in 1921.[51]\nMartin Heidegger, meanwhile, argued that \"the surrounding world is different for each of us, and notwithstanding that we move about in a common world\".[52]\n\"World\" is one of the key terms in Eugen Fink's philosophy.[53] He thinks that there is a misguided tendency in western philosophy to understand the world as one enormously big thing containing all the small everyday things we are familiar with.[54] He sees this view as a form of forgetfulness of the world and tries to oppose it by what he calls the \"cosmological difference\": the difference between the world and the inner-worldly things it contains.[54] On his view, the world is the totality of the inner-worldly things that transcends them.[55] It is itself groundless but it provides a ground for things. It therefore cannot be identified with a mere container. Instead, the world gives appearance to inner-worldly things, it provides them with a place, a beginning and an end.[54] One difficulty in investigating the world is that we never encounter it since it is not just one more thing that appears to us. This is why Fink uses the notion of play or playing to elucidate the nature of the world.[54][55] He sees play as a symbol of the world that is both part of it and that represents it.[56] Play usually comes with a form of imaginary play-world involving various things relevant to the play. But just like the play is more than the imaginary realities appearing in it so the world is more than the actual things appearing in it.[54][56]\nThe concept of worlds plays a central role in Nelson Goodman's late philosophy.[57] He argues that we need to posit different worlds in order to account for the fact that there are different incompatible truths found in reality.[58] Two truths are incompatible if they ascribe incompatible properties to the same thing.[57] This happens, for example, when we assert both that the earth moves and that the earth is at rest. These incompatible truths correspond to two different ways of describing the world: heliocentrism and geocentrism.[58] Goodman terms such descriptions \"world versions\". He holds a correspondence theory of truth: a world version is true if it corresponds to a world. Incompatible true world versions correspond to different worlds.[58] It is common for theories of modality to posit the existence of a plurality of possible worlds. But Goodman's theory is different since it posits a plurality not of possible but of actual worlds.[57][5] Such a position is in danger of involving a contradiction: there cannot be a plurality of actual worlds if worlds are defined as maximally inclusive wholes.[57][5] This danger may be avoided by interpreting Goodman's world-concept not as maximally inclusive wholes in the absolute sense but in relation to its corresponding world-version: a world contains all and only the entities that its world-version describes.[57][5]\nMythological cosmologies depict the world as centered on an axis mundi and delimited by a boundary such as a world ocean, a world serpent or similar.[59][60]\nHinduism constitutes a family of religious-philosophical views.[61] These views present perspectives on the nature and role of the world. Samkhya philosophy, for example, is a metaphysical dualism that understands reality as comprising 2 parts: purusha and prakriti.[62] The term \"purusha\" stands for the individual conscious self that each of \"us\" possesses. Prakriti, on the other hand, is the 1 world inhabited by all these selves.[63] Samkhya understands this world as a world of matter governed by the law of cause and effect.[62] The term \"matter\" is understood in a sense in this tradition including physical and mental aspects.[64] This is reflected in the doctrine of tattvas, according to which prakriti is made up of 23 principles or elements of reality.[64] These principles include physical elements, like water or earth, and mental aspects, like intelligence or sense-impressions.[63] The relation between purusha and prakriti is conceived as 1 of observation: purusha is the conscious self aware of the world of prakriti and does not causally interact with it.[62]\nA conception of the world is present in Advaita Vedanta, the monist school among the Vedanta schools.[61] Unlike the realist position defended in Samkhya philosophy, Advaita Vedanta sees the world of multiplicity as an illusion, referred to as Maya.[61] This illusion includes impression of existing as separate experiencing selfs called Jivas.[65] Instead, Advaita Vedanta teaches that on the most fundamental level of reality, referred to as Brahman, there exists no plurality or difference.[65] All there is is 1 all-encompassing self: Atman.[61] Ignorance is seen as the source of this illusion, which results in bondage to the world of mere appearances. Liberation is possible in the course of overcoming this illusion by acquiring the knowledge of Brahman, according to Advaita Vedanta.[65]\nContemptus mundi is the name given to the belief that the world, in all its vanity, is nothing more than a futile attempt to hide from God by stifling our desire for the good and the holy.[66] This view has been characterised as a \"pastoral of fear\" by historian Jean Delumeau.[67] \"The world, the flesh, and the devil\" is a traditional division of the sources of temptation.[68]\nOrbis Catholicus is a Latin phrase meaning \"Catholic world\", per the expression Urbi et Orbi, and refers to that area of Christendom under papal supremacy.[69]\nIn Islam, the term \"dunya\" is used for the world. Its meaning is derived from the root word \"dana\", a term for \"near\".[70] It is associated with the temporal, sensory world and earthly concerns, i.e. with this world in contrast to the spiritual world.[71] Religious teachings warn of a tendency to seek happiness in this world and advise a more ascetic lifestyle concerned with the afterlife.[72] Other strands in Islam recommend a balanced approach.[71]\nIn Mandaean cosmology, the world or earthly realm is known as Tibil. It is separated from the World of Light (alma d-nhÅ«ra) above and the World of Darkness (alma d-hÅ¡uka) below by aether (ayar).[73][74]\nA worldview is a comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it.[75] As a representation, it is a subjective perspective of the world and thereby different from the world it represents.[76] All higher animals need to represent their environment in some way in order to navigate it. But it has been argued that only humans possess a representation encompassing enough to merit the term \"worldview\".[76] Philosophers of worldviews commonly hold that the understanding of any object depends on a worldview constituting the background on which this understanding can take place. This may affect not just our intellectual understanding of the object in question but the experience of it in general.[75] It is therefore impossible to assess one's worldview from a neutral perspective since this assessment already presupposes the worldview as its background. Some hold that each worldview is based on a single hypothesis that promises to solve all the problems of our existence we may encounter.[77] On this interpretation, the term is closely associated to the worldviews given by different religions.[77] Worldviews offer orientation not just in theoretical matters but also in practical matters. For this reason, they usually include answers to the question of the meaning of life and other evaluative components about what matters and how we should act.[78][79] A worldview can be unique to one individual but worldviews are usually shared by many people within a certain culture or religion.\nThe idea that there exist many different worlds is found in various fields. For example, theories of modality talk about a plurality of possible worlds and the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics carries this reference even in its name. Talk of different worlds is also common in everyday language, for example, with reference to the world of music, the world of business, the world of football, the world of experience or the Asian world. But at the same time, worlds are usually defined as all-inclusive totalities.[5][6][15][14] This seems to contradict the very idea of a plurality of worlds since if a world is total and all-inclusive then it cannot have anything outside itself. Understood this way, a world can neither have other worlds besides itself or be part of something bigger.[5][57] One way to resolve this paradox while holding onto the notion of a plurality of worlds is to restrict the sense in which worlds are totalities. On this view, worlds are not totalities in an absolute sense.[5] This might be even understood in the sense that, strictly speaking, there are no worlds at all.[57] Another approach understands worlds in a schematic sense: as context-dependent expressions that stand for the current domain of discourse. So in the expression \"Around the World in Eighty Days\", the term \"world\" refers to the earth while in the colonial[80] expression \"the New World\" it refers to the landmass of North and South America.[15]\nCosmogony is the field that studies the origin or creation of the world. This includes both scientific cosmogony and creation myths found in various religions.[81][82] The dominant theory in scientific cosmogony is the Big Bang theory, according to which both space, time and matter have their origin in one initial singularity occurring about 13.8 billion years ago. This singularity was followed by an expansion that allowed the universe to sufficiently cool down for the formation of subatomic particles and later atoms. These initial elements formed giant clouds, which would then coalesce into stars and galaxies.[16] Non-scientific creation myths are found in many cultures and are often enacted in rituals expressing their symbolic meaning.[81] They can be categorized concerning their contents. Types often found include creation from nothing, from chaos or from a cosmic egg.[81]\nEschatology refers to the science or doctrine of the last things or of the end of the world. It is traditionally associated with religion, specifically with the Abrahamic religions.[83][84] In this form, it may include teachings both of the end of each individual human life and of the end of the world as a whole. But it has been applied to other fields as well, for example, in the form of physical eschatology, which includes scientifically based speculations about the far future of the universe.[85] According to some models, there will be a Big Crunch in which the whole universe collapses back into a singularity, possibly resulting in a second Big Bang afterward. But current astronomical evidence seems to suggest that our universe will continue to expand indefinitely.[85]\nWorld history studies the world from a historical perspective. Unlike other approaches to history, it employs a global viewpoint. It deals less with individual nations and civilizations, which it usually approaches at a high level of abstraction.[86] Instead, it concentrates on wider regions and zones of interaction, often interested in how people, goods and ideas move from one region to another.[87] It includes comparisons of different societies and civilizations as well as considering wide-ranging developments with a long-term global impact like the process of industrialization.[86] Contemporary world history is dominated by three main research paradigms determining the periodization into different epochs.[88] One is based on productive relations between humans and nature. The two most important changes in history in this respect were the introduction of agriculture and husbandry concerning the production of food, which started around 10,000 to 8,000 BCE and is sometimes termed the Neolithic Revolution, and the Industrial Revolution, which started around 1760 CE and involved the transition from manual to industrial manufacturing.[89][90][88] Another paradigm, focusing on culture and religion instead, is based on Karl Jaspers' theories about the Axial Age, a time in which various new forms of religious and philosophical thoughts appeared in several separate parts of the world around the time between 800 and 200 BCE.[88] A third periodization is based on the relations between civilizations and societies. According to this paradigm, history can be divided into three periods in relation to the dominant region in the world: Middle Eastern dominance before 500 BCE, Eurasian cultural balance until 1500 CE and Western dominance since 1500 CE.[88] Big History employs an even wider framework than world history by putting human history into the context of the history of the universe as a whole. It starts with the Big Bang and traces the formation of galaxies, the Solar System, the Earth, its geological eras, the evolution of life and humans until the present day.[88]\nWorld politics, also referred to as global politics or international relations, is the discipline of political science studying issues of interest to the world that transcend nations and continents.[91][92] It aims to explain complex patterns found in the social world that are often related to the pursuit of power, order and justice, usually in the context of globalization. It focuses not just on the relations between nation-states but also considers other transnational actors, like multinational corporations, terrorist groups, or non-governmental organizations.[93] For example, it tries to explain events such as the September 11 attacks, the 2003 invasion of Iraq or the 2008 financial crisis.\nVarious theories have been proposed in order to deal with the complexity involved in formulating such explanations.[93] These theories are sometimes divided into realism, liberalism and constructivism.[94] Realists see nation-states as the main actors in world politics. They constitute an anarchical international system without any overarching power to control their behavior. They are seen as sovereign agents that, determined by human nature, act according to their national self-interest. Military force may play an important role in the ensuing struggle for power between states, but diplomacy and cooperation are also key mechanisms for nations to achieve their goals.[93][95][96] Liberalists acknowledge the importance of states but they also emphasize the role of transnational actors, like the United Nations or the World Trade Organization. They see humans as perfectible and stress the role of democracy in this process. The emergent order in world politics, on this perspective, is more complex than a mere balance of power since more different agents and interests are involved in its production.[93][97] Constructivism ascribes more importance to the agency of individual humans than realism and liberalism. It understands the social world as a construction of the people living in it. This leads to an emphasis on the possibility of change. If the international system is an anarchy of nation-states, as the realists hold, then this is only so because we made it this way and may change since this is not prefigured by human nature, according to the constructivists.[93][98]", "position": 1}

{"title": "What is âWorldâ? | Absurd Being", "content": "In its grandest conception the world is simply the whole of the physical universe. If this sounds about right, then you have probably accepted the scientific/materialistic paradigm that saturates the modern intellectual atmosphere without realising there are any alternatives aside from crackpot religious or new age ones. This article will challenge this prevailing scientific/materialistic notion of world, specifically arguing that it is neither (1) fundamental nor (2) complete, and is, in fact, both (3) meaningless and (4) misleading.\nOf course, there is nothing incoherent about defining âworldâ as the totality of physical matter in the universe. The problem isnât one of coherence, but of scope and relevance. Given its limitations, my argument is that despite being coherent in an insular kind of way, it isnât the best definition of the word, and doesnât even reflect what we typically mean when we use it.\n(1) Fundamental\nCurrent dominant opinion defines âworldâ as the objective physical universe and this is grounded in the idea that matter is fundamental. Physical matter (electrons and quarks) is fundamental because the âmacroâ world of tables, chairs, and human beings is dependent on it in a way that physical matter isnât dependent on the âmacroâ world. There would be no such things as tables and chairs without electrons and quarks but this doesnât hold the other way around. This is unquestionably true.\nHowever, we must ask what exactly this âworldâ the scientist/materialist is defining as objective physical matter really is. Is it tables and chairs and human beings? No, it isnât. Itâs electrons and quarks. Arenât they the same thing? No, they arenât. A universe full of nothing but electrons and quarks arranged in configurations indistinguishable from that of the tables and chairs we are all familiar with would still not have a single table or chair in it. This is not for the trivial reason that there is no one around to call a particular configuration of electrons and quarks a chair, but for the deeper one that there would be no reason, out of all the possible perspectives that could be adopted, to privilege this particular perspective over any other. In other words, remove the specific, narrow human perspective from the equation, which is to say, reduce the world to an objective accounting of electrons and quarks, and that is exactly what you are left with, a meaningless jumble of electrons and quarks, everywhere! Your table is electrons and quarks, so is the chair, so is the air in between them! Itâs all just electrons and quarks. In my opinion this tangle of particles canât seriously be called a âworldâ and it is certainly not what anyone means when they use the word.\nAt this point, you might choose to take a stand and reasonably argue that âworldâ is just electrons and quarks, not tables and chairs. As I said, there is nothing incoherent about taking this position but it is one that, while on the one hand contains everything, on the other it contains nothing because its contents are all the same thing, an undifferentiated jumble of particles! It also doesnât do justice to the way we use, or think about, the word âworldâ. The human âworldâ is a much richer concept than merely referring to all the electrons and quarks in the universe. So when we talk about the âworld of ââ, where âââ can mean any sphere of interest; âfine wineâ, âboxingâ, etc, we arenât wanting to discuss the electrons and quarks that make up fine wine. Likewise, having a pessimistic world-view doesnât mean you have negative thoughts about electrons and quarks.\nSo, that was the first step in my argument but it was a negative one in that all it does is shed light on the inadequacy of âworldâ as conceived in scientific/materialistic terms; i.e. as just brute, un-interpreted, unobserved, objective, physical matter. We must now search for the positive step which will reveal the fundamental conception of âworldâ. Along the way, we will hopefully dispose of any lingering doubts you might have concerning my dismissal of the scientific/materialistic âworldâ.\nEven granting my thesis that electrons and quarks donât make a âworldâ, you might still insist that these electrons and quarks are fundamental in the sense that they are ontologically prior; i.e. they exist first then we come along and perceive them through our specific sensory and cognitive lenses in such a way that things like tables and chairs are disclosed. This is once again, true. The problem is that âphysical matterâ (electrons and quarks) is not our original, fundamental reality. These electrons and quarks are originally and fundamentally disclosed to us as âworldâ, in my richer sense of the term. No human being detects electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength of 680nm and then sees the colour red. Nor does any human being detect the compression and rarefaction of molecules propagating through the air and then hear a friend talking. The physical universe around us is originally, primordially, fundamentally disclosed in full technicolour and jam-packed with shapes, textures, smells, functional relations, meaning, and a hundred other subjective qualities.\nYou are probably still tempted to argue that even though this is true, these are secondary qualities; qualities we overlay on an already existing, therefore fundamental, physical world. To which I would reply, seeing these things as secondary qualities is to already have smuggled in a perspective; i.e. it presupposes a âworldâ complete with measuring equipment, theories, table, and chairs. And that is precisely my point. The first thing we perceive is a âworldâ of tables and chairs, not a mass of electrons and quarks. The electrons and quarks are derived only after we apprehend the âworldâ.\nBut, you will be thinking now, that is only because of the senses we have and the way our brains and bodies have evolved. Of course. Again, this is my whole point. Without senses, brains, and bodies, there wouldnât be anything; it would all just be a chaotic mass of electrons and quarks. âWorldâ arises at the intersection of a conscious subject and physical matter and it is fundamental because prior to âworldâ, there is no experience (all experience is necessarily experience of a âworldâ) and nothing (without a subjective perspective physical reality is just a jumble of undifferentiated particles).\nNow you are probably ready to object that this is relativism on steroids. âWorldâ as I have described it here is completely different to creatures differently physically constituted. Bees, who see in ultraviolet, live in a different âworldâ from us. Dolphins, using echolocation, live in yet another âworldâ. Even colour blind humans live in different âworldsâ from those of us who arenât colour blind. Surely, this is nonsense. How can all of these different âworldsâ be fundamental?\nThis objection contains the implicit assumption that a âworldâ we can call fundamental must be the same for everyone. This is precisely the assumption this article is challenging. Indeed, why should âworldâ be the same for everyone given the fact that everyoneâs senses and experiences differ slightly, not to mention the greater differences across species? Sure, the underlying physical matter is the same for everyone, but as Iâm arguing here, clumps of electrons and quarks are inadequate for, and greatly impoverish, any reasonable definition of the word âworldâ.\nIf we start to think of âworldâ as electrons and quarks, itâs a short hop from there to thinking of humans as computers and consciousness as software, which is only a stoneâs throw away from thinking of conscious life as the purely mechanical processing of data (because how could one clump of electrons and quarks âcareâ or âvalueâ another clump of electrons and quarks?), by which time our thoughts about conscious life no longer correspond with our actual lives and weâve probably gone so far down the rabbit hole that we canât even see light anymore.\n(2) Completeness\nAt first blush, it might appear that a material description of the physical matter in the universe would be the most complete description of that universe possible. This is not quite right. What it is, is a complete description of what that universe is composed of (electrons and quarks), but as should be clear to anyone currently perceiving this article as more than a jumble of electrons and quarks, something is missing from such a description.\nLet me begin with a question. What is water? The materialist answer is as automatic as it is uninteresting; electrons and quarks. This response is automatic because itâs true, but uninteresting because everything is electrons and quarks. And yet, despite the fact that water is electrons and quarks (like everything else in the universe), it is also somehow different from everything else in the universe that isnât water. What accounts for this difference?\nThatâs easy, says the materialist. The difference turns on the way those electrons and quarks are arranged; what could be called the âinformational contentâ of the electrons and quarks. Again, this is true. It is a complete physical description of water, but is it a complete description? If you were describing water to someone who had never seen it before, would you feel as if you had done an adequate job by specifying that water is a certain configuration of electrons and quarks? No matter how much detail you went into, such a description would be forever inadequate, indeed, it would be laughably so.\nThe truth is you could never properly describe water (or anything, for that matter) without going beyond its physical characteristics. Any adequate description would have to include the way water appears to our senses (colour: clear; shape: free, it moulds to the shape of its container; feel: wet; etc.) and it would also have to give some indication of what it is for; water is for swimming in, for washing things, for drinking, etc.\nBut hold on. This prompts an immediate objection. These things donât describe what water is; they more appropriately describe the human beings perceiving and using the water. This objection is partially true. They donât describe humans but neither do they describe water; rather, they describe the point at which the two intersect. And this takes us back to the key point already made in the first section, it is only at this intersection that water, as we know it, as it means anything to us, exists.\nThere is a famous thought experiment that perfectly illustrates this point. Imagine a woman, Mary, who has lived in a black and white room her whole life. She has never seen colour. However, she has been given a thorough scientific explanation of what colour is; how the different wavelengths of light are reflected and absorbed differently by different substances, how the light perceived in the eyes is translated to electrical and chemical signals, relayed through the optic nerve to the brain, etc. The question is, is Maryâs understanding of colour complete? Does she know everything there is to know about colour? You might think she does but what if Mary leaves the room and suddenly sees colour for the first time. Does she learn anything new?\nWe can do the same thing for water. Imagine Mary has never seen or touched water but she has been given a thorough explanation of the physical composition of water. Perhaps she even knows more than we do. Maybe she has learned how tiny strings vibrating in ten dimensions produce the specific electrons and quarks that make the atoms that make the molecules that comprise H2O. And yet having never seen or touched any of it, how could anyone claim she has a complete understanding of water?\nThere is a tendency here to make the same objection as we saw in the first section; the âcompleteâ understanding you are talking about is relative to particular life forms (beings with different physical/sensory attributes would give different âcompleteâ descriptions of water) and contingent (there is no reason why water has the qualities in your âcompleteâ description).\nYes to both and no to the objection. Why must a complete description be one that is the same for different life forms with different bodies/senses? Why canât it be contingent? The only reason you are insisting on this fixed, objective, true at all times and places for all beings description is because that is how science sees the world and scientists have convinced you that is the way the world really is. This is exactly what I am challenging here. Science deliberately removes all traces of subjectivity precisely so its measurements are valid at all times and places for all beings. And that is as it should be. Itâs what we want of science! If science wasnât like that it would be useless. But donât make the mistake of thinking this approach to the âworldâ is more valid, or somehow truer, or more complete than one that acknowledges and adopts a specific perspective.\nUltimately, that is all I am arguing for here; physical matter only deserves to be called a âworldâ if it is disclosed from a specific perspective. Hence a complete description of a âworldâ can only be given with reference to a specific perspective. This makes perfect sense as soon as one brings into question the, often unchallenged, assumption that an objective, scientific description of physical matter is the only one that matters.\nIt is also worth noting that people were talking about the âworldâ long before science and the scientific method burst onto the scene. It obviously used to mean something more than mere collections of physical particles. Why has science hijacked this word, a rich word that implies so much more than the physical composition of the universe, and reduced it to electrons and quarks? Why is science not content with using words like âmatterâ or âthe physical universeâ to reference its domain? Itâs because science doesnât think it has a domain. It thinks its domain is everything. Using the phrase âthe physical universeâ implies that this is only part of a greater whole or that there is another way of thinking about the universe, one not restricted to electrons and quarks. And this thought is anathema to it.\n(3) Meaninglessness\nWhat is meaning? Well, for a start, it isnât purpose. Even inanimate things have purposes, a chairâs purpose is to support my weight when I sit on it, but we wouldnât want to ascribe any kind of meaning in being a chair. What about purpose plus consciousness? This is a little better but still doesnât get us to meaning. A purpose, as opposed to a goal, seems to imply a reason for existing and this implies, to me at least, that it was given by some external force. If I write a computer program to perform some action A whenever I press ctrl + p on my keyboard, then it makes sense to say that that program has a purpose, a reason for existing; namely, to do A. The catch is that the purpose comes in the form of a directive given by me. The program itself has no choice in the matter. Even if the program is a conscious AI, its purpose, to do A whenever I press ctrl + p, doesnât give it meaning. Some people think that God created them with a purpose or reason for existing, and they claim this gives them meaning. This seems clearly untrue. If there is any meaning in such a situation, it is all on Godâs side, not ours. We are merely slavishly fulfilling our purpose; or rather, Godâs purpose for us.\nAnd now we have our first positive formulation. Meaning must come from the agent him or herself. It cannot be given or bestowed by someone else like a purpose can. So what do we mean when we say such and such is meaningful to us? Well, I think we basically mean it is important. This suggests that there are other things less important. And degrees of importance can only be implemented if we have something else; value. Value is the key to meaning.\nIn the scientist/materialistâs âworldâ of electrons and quarks what is there to value? Remember, the insistence here is that the âworldâ is objective physical matter; fundamental particles interacting in accordance with strict laws of causality. There is nothing of value in this âworldâ because there is quite literally no-thing; itâs all fundamental particles. No value means no meaning, and no meaning means meaninglessness.\nMoving in the opposite direction; meaningfulness indicates the presence of values, values refer to a valuer, and a valuer (alongside physical matter, of course) suggests a space in which distinct things with qualities and functions are disclosed. This space is precisely what I have been arguing for here; i.e. âworldâ.\n(4) Misleading\nAn objection that might have occurred to you while you were reading this is that I am engaging in mere semantics, quibbling over terms. Specifically, you might think: 1) that I am trying to redefine the word âworldâ, and 2) that there is no argument here; all we have is two different definitions, each valid with regard to their concerns.\nMy first reaction to this objection is to note that it absolutely is semantics but it is anything but âmereâ. To the first point; in a way it is true, I am trying to redefine the word âworldâ, although I would say I am trying to take back a word that science had already hijacked for its own hegemonic ambitions. At some point in the past two to three centuries we stopped valuing and taking seriously our subjective, lived experience and began glorifying objective, scientific measurements, despite the fact that they are woefully inadequate when it comes to describing human life and human experience. Anything not scientific and objective became a fiction, unreal. âSubjectiveâ no longer describes a situation from the perspective of a subject; it is now used almost exclusively as a synonym for âfalseâ, âillusoryâ, or âopinionâ; the opposite of true, genuine, and fact.\nLikewise, the word âworldâ is another casualty in scienceâs imperialistic campaign. It used to be full of meaning and relevance, and rich with subjective details; now it has been reduced to a sterile mass of particles bereft of any meaning or significance. Of course, scientists are humans as well and not one of them would describe their âworldâ as sterile or bereft of meaning, but that is my whole point. There is a disconnect going on. They see and feel the beauty in the world just as acutely as non-scientists, if not more so, while at the same time refusing to acknowledge that this beauty doesnât, and canât, exist in their reductive descriptions.\nThe second point, that there is no real argument here, is exactly what I am rallying against with this essay. Words are important because they influence our thoughts. Forfeiting the word âworldâ to science conditions us to think about everything (after all, that is what the world is) in scientific terms until the idea that the human brain is a computer (not like one, is one) seems plausible, or lived emotions are illusory (because how could one lump of matter care about another lump of matter). No one lives as if these things are true of course, and that is the point. A divide is opening up between the way we think about conscious experience and human life on the one hand and the way we actually live it on the other. And since the words we use significantly influence the thoughts we think, we ought to be very careful with some of our âmereâ semantics.\nPhilosophy and Reality\nOctober 7, 2018\nIn \"philosophy\"\nMaterialism â The Unlikely Hypothesis\nOctober 2, 2016\nIn \"philosophy\"\nThe Value of Philosophy\nMay 9, 2020\nIn \"philosophy\"", "position": 7}
