    "optimized_final": "{\n  \"final_answer\": \"The sun is a G-type main-sequence star, a massive celestial body composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, at the center of our solar system. Through nuclear fusion in its core, it converts hydrogen to helium, releasing tremendous energy as light and heat, which is essential for life on Earth, driving weather patterns, supporting plant growth, and warming our planet, while its gravity holds the planets in orbit.\"\n}"

Its core generates immense energy through nuclear fusion, releasing light and heat that support life on Earth, drive weather patterns, and enable photosynthesis. The Sun's gravity also holds the planets in their orbits, creating the structure of our solar system.\"\n}"
